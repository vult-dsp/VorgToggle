# Vorg Toggle

The Vult Vorg filter uses an ATTiny85 to control a solid state switch that changes the filter from Low Pass to High Pass. The main reason I used a combination of a uC + switch was that I wanted to avoid using mechanical switches. Mechanical switches can be expensive and harder to source. To avoid issues, I opted for this combination which works quite well.

## Notes

It is recommended to configure the ATTiny85 with an internal clock of 1 MHz.
